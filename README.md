# Guess My Number

In a simple JavaScript game with a classic pixel art design, you'll embark on a quest to guess a random number between 1 and 20. Each guess earns you hints, but be careful - incorrect guesses deduct points from your starting score of 20.

Can you crack the code and achieve the highest score? Test your luck and logic now! ðŸ˜€
