# Guess My Number

In a simple JavaScript game with a classic pixel art design, you'll embark on a quest to guess a random number between 1 and 100. Each guess earns a hint, but be careful â€“ each incorrect guess deducts 1 point from the 100 starting score.

Can you crack the code and achieve the highest score? Test your luck and logic now! ðŸ˜€
